# 1. Computer Set Up
The following items incude those that should be considered when setting up your computer for data science. For most items, there is (will be) a linked guide that can be found under the "Resoruces > Guides " directory in this repository.The items include:

    1a. Applications to Download/Install - You may choose your preferred editor, but VSCode is the tool I and many software developers use. Others include Spyder, PyCharm, etc You may also wish to install GitHub Desktop, or any other tools of choice for more convenient workflows. 
        - VSCode (or preferred editor)
        - Github Desktop

    1b. Environment set up - The follow list includes required or optional installs for data science in general as wellas completion of this mentorship. You will be required to use python 3.X, preferably â‰¥ python 3.6X. Python can be installed via Anaconda (recommended for beginners and learners), or through homebrew. MacOS can hold more than 1 installation of python, while on Windows, python must be upgraded when desired. The list of essential packages to install should be intalled right away, if not existent. To check if they are installed, try:
    ``bash
    pip3 freeze
    ```

    Note: Virtual environments (using Virtualenv or recommended pyenv) is highly recommended, but not required. See Guides directory for how to setup a virtual environment for a project. 

    - Installing python
        - Anaconda (recommended beginner set up)
        - Homebrew / Python Releases Site
    - Python Maintainence
        - Mac vs Windows
        - VirtualEnvAnaconda
        - Installing with PIP
    - Essential Package Installs (PIP) - Must install
        - Numpy
        - Pandas
        - SKLearn
        - SciPy
        - Matplotlib
        - Seaborn
        - Jupyter
        - Pytest
    - Optional Packages to install
        - Keras / Pytorch / Tensorflow
        - Scrapy / BeautifulSoup
        - Dask
        - tqdm


# 2. Need To Knows
The items below include either workflows, skills or knwowledge sets that you will need to be comfortable with during mentorship. It is okay if you are not completely fluent at the start, but if that is the case, review should be done very early to catch up and get the most out of mentorship. The items include:

    - Navigating your computer with terminal
    - Launching & utilizing Jupyter notebooks
    - Interacting with Github & using the git command-line workflow
    - Basic principles of python
    - Good undertanding of Calculus, including linear algebra, partial derivatives, etc.


# 4. Unique to You
Details specific to this mentee-mentor period

## Overview
During this mentorship, we will be foucsing on:
    1. Review of Data Science concepts
    2. Testing your ability to implement DS concepts
    3. Refining your programming quality
    4. Improving your understanding of the DS life cycle in a professional setting
    5. Preparing you for the job hunt!

## Timeline
This mentorhsip will ideally last 2-3 months. As you have stated that obtaining a job is your number one priority, the goal is to have you ready for the job hunt nearing the end of the mentorhsip, and hopefully finding employment soon after. That said, below is our tentative timeline plan for this mentorhsip, lasting 9+ weeks

Week 1: 
- Review all onboarding materials 
- Skills assessment
- Review gaps in DS concepts/knowledge/skills

Week 2:
- EDA Project
- Test-set1
- Finish reviewing concepts

Week 3-5:
- Exhaustive Modeling Project
- Test-sets 2-4

Week 6-6:
- Recommendation Engine Project
- Test-set 5-6

Week 8+
- Interview Preparation
- Final Test-set

Weekly:
- Review articles - focusing on data science in production and in professional settings
- Continue to review DS concepts
- Progress updates (conversational)

## Expectaions

### Overall
1. You will stay committed to the mentorship, and complete all work
2. I am happy to amend the plan based on your needs as we move along, but you have to (1) be honest with yourself, and (2) be honest with me about where you are at
3. After employment is obtained, there will be a collection over 12 months of 4% of your starting salary (agreed to in SharpestMinds contract) 
4. Open door! Let me know how you're feeling, what you need and how we can best work together!

### Git Workflow
For this mentorship, you will be forking this repository, and working off of the branch: *"coreyholt"*. Your forked version of this repository will allow you to have a copy within your own github account, as well as having an opportunity to practice standard procedure for collaborative data science work (with me). That said, you will be developing entirely on the aforementioned branch & therefore have freedom to push & pull from your forked repository as yuo wish. Periodically, I will be asking you to submit pull requests to the original repository (owned by me), requiring my (rdowd003) as a required reviewer, so that I will be able to see your work. 

### Projects
For this mentorship, I have planned 3 projects for you to complete. They will cover: exploratory analyses & feature engineering, modeling & ML., and recommendation systems & data tooling. Each of these topics were chosen because comfort with each is *absolutely essential* to landing a data science job. For each project, you will add a new subdirectory under the projects directory, with a README.md file in each, providing a brief overview & summary (once completed) of the project, for other to see. As you are inteerested in developing your skills as a data story teller and feeling more comfortable collating & presenting your results, **you will complete a slide deck** erviewing results for each project. We can go over this together once complete for feedback. 

Some projects will vary, but in general, you will be submitting a directory with: 
- src/ - directory with python files and/or jupyter notebooks - EDA, modeling, hyperparameter tuning, explorations, etc
- data/ - directory with any data you utilized
- results/ - directory with slide deck (pdf file) of results & any data/ output  


### Weekly Work
An important part to being a successful data scientist is continuously reviewing, learning & exploring. There are far too many concepts to encompass in a 2-3 month mentorhsip, and so it will be on you to stay on top of your progress & gaps, with a little help from me. Each will you will do some work to help build a better knowledge base of the data science life cycle & technical capabilities outside of the basics. Each week you will do the following:

- Review article (sent by me, or something you find). Add summmary to article directory
- Complete test-set (keeping you up to date on python, sql skills & concepts)
- Complete code & test-set reviews with me
- Provide me with progress updates on where you feel like you need more help.
