Concepts Assessment

##############################################################################################################################
All of the concepts tested below are absolutely essential to (1) passing data science interviews, 
(2) understanding foundations of more complex topics, and (3) success as a data scientist. Each of
these topics are commonly asked about in both conceptual & code-based knowledge testing interviews
for data scientist positions. 

Responses do not need to be extensive. Explain where you feel it is necessary, but 
simplified / general answers will suffice, unless the question is asking for a specific calculation or definition

QUESTIONS

###
1. What is the difference between a mutable and immutable data type in python? Give an example of each
immutable: can't edit it (tuples)
mutable: variables, lists, dictionaries, etc

###
2. Describe the difference between under- & overfitting models
underfitting: The model doesn't match the data very well. It doesn't predict well on train or test data. Could occur because of too little data or inccorect model 
overfitting: The model predicts well for the training data but not test data--aka it doesn't generalize well. The model probably wasn't cross validated during training

###
3. What types of scenarios are the following distributions typically applied in?
Binomial: distribution of 2 potential outcomes: coin flip, win/lose
Geometric:
Poisson:
Exponential: distirbution for time between occurences. 


###
4. How are models scores? What are some metrics that can be used to determine the success of a model? 
classification: accuracy, f1 score, ROC, AUC
regression: MAE, MSE, R squared, adjusted R2

###
5. What is a method to handle an imbalanced dataset when doing classification?
resampling, augment/generate data, use models that penalize misclassification of minority class

###
6. What is regulariation? Describe the difference between L1 & L2 regularization
Regularization is used to reduce overfitting in ML models by reducing coefficients
L1 (lasso): "penalizes sum of absolute values of weights". Robust to outliers. 
Can reduce weights to zero (built-in feature selection)
L2 (ridge): "penalizes sum of squares of weights

###
7. What is an ROC curve? What are the axes? How do you use an ROC curve to determine model success?
Graph representing the classification accuracy of a model
Plots true positive rate (y-axis) vs false positive rate (x-axis)

###
8. What are some common methods for processing text data prior to conducting NLP?


###
9. What is a term-frequency - inverse-document-frequency (tf-idf) matrix (related to NLP)?
Matrix that shows the importance of a word in a corpus

###
10. How does one search for data in a non-relational database (i.e., no rows or columns)?


###
11. What is Docker? Why is it useful to data scientists? (hint, consider productionizing models)
You can capture your local environment using a docker container to ensure your model deploys with 
all of the necessary dependencies.
