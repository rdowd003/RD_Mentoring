Concepts Assessment - SOLUTIONS

##############################################################################################################################
All of the concepts tested below are absolutely essential to (1) passing data science interviews, 
(2) understanding foundations of more complex topics, and (3) success as a data scientist. Each of
these topics are commonly asked about in both conceptual & code-based knowledge testing interviews
for data scientist positions. 

Responses do not need to be extensive. Explain where you feel it is necessary, but 
simplified / general answers will suffice, unless the question is asking for a specific calculation or definition

###
5. Flipping a fair coin 3 times, which has a higher probability of occurring first (or neither)?
    a. HTT
    b. HTH

> HHT is more likely to appear first than HTT. 
The probability of HHT appearing first is 2/3 and so probability of HTT appearing first is 1/3

###
6. What is a p-value? How do you interpret the value?
(Hint: the answer should include more than "statistical significance")

> A p-value is a numerical indicator used to determine if, in a statistical experiment, it can be 
concluded that the result found is not due to chance, or the null hypothesis. The p-value
does not inherently confirm the alternative hypothesis or our scientific conclusion, while it does
confirm that the same results would not be found randomly in nature. 

###
7. What is the formula for Bayes Conditional probability? What does each component represent?

> P(A|B) = P(B|A)*P(A) / P(B)
P(B|A) = Conditional probability of B, given A ("likelihood")
P(A) = Independent probability of A ("prior")
P(B) = Independent probability of B ("marginalization")

###
8. What is the difference between an independent-sample vs paired-sample t-test? 

> Give an example set up where you'd use each
Independent sample test is used when comparing 2 different populations, where once receives 
a particular treatment. A paired test is used when a time-based comparison is being made
eithr within the same sample, or within a cohort

###
9. Nathan makes 60% of his free-throw attempts. If he shoots 12 free throws, what is the probability that he makes exactly 10?
(hint, use binomial distribution - feel free to use a python library, and paste code below if you do)

> 

###
10. What is bootstrapping? How can bootsrtapping be used in the model development process?

> Resampling *with* replacement - can be used in ML development when trying to determine if 
a model parameter is the right value. Can re-sample parameter space using bootstrapping technique

###
11. What are the assumptions of linear regression?

>
1. Direct relationship between predictors & target
2. No multicollinearity
3. Homoscedasticity of residuals
4. Normal distribution of residuals

###
12. Considering the development of an image classification model, what is a scenario / application 
in which you would want to prioritize precision over recal (sensitivity)? What about recall over precision?

> prioritze precision when false negatives are highest priority (disease/cancer identification)
  prioritize recall when you don't want false negatives (a "model" of death sentence jury)

### IGNORE
13. Given the same model output as above, answer the following questions:
    a. What do you notice about the class-balance of actual labels?
    
    b. What is the impact of your answer to (a) on the model's ability to successfully predict the given labels?

###
13. What calculations are required to be made at each split of a decision tree algorithm?

> Purity (Gini index, entropy) & Information gain

###
14. What parameter(s) is (are) randomized in a Random Forest classifier?

> Split features

###
15. What is gradient boosting & why is it useful?

> An ensemble model approach with several weak learners, where each consecutive model
is optimized off of the residuals of the prior

###
16. In clustering algoriths like Kmeans, how do data points get assigned to clusters?

> There are several start options (Weighted, heuristic, optimized, random), and all data points
are assigned to initialized foci using distance metrics (manhattan,standard, etc.)

###
17. What are the steps involved in collaborative filtering? What is the difference betwen user- & item-based collaborative filtering?

> 
1. Collect ratings from multiple users
2. Matrix factorization
3. Calculate similarity across users
4. Select highest user similarity
5. Recommend second users highest rates items

User-user: Described above, recommend items that are well rated by users similar to target user
Item-item: Find target users high rated item, find similar items from other users (well rated)
and recommend similar item(s)

###
18. In the neural-network architecture described below (assume all layers to be dense - i.e. fully connected),
fill in the missing array shapes:
(Hint, neural networks typically follow: output = X.W + b)

>
Input layer:
    - Input shape: 3x1
Single Hidden layer (2 nodes, tanh activation)
    - Weights shape: 3x2
    - Bias_h shape: 3x1
    - Activation function output shape: 2x1
Final Output layer (2 nodes, sigmoid activation)
    - Weights shape: 2x2
    - Bias_o shape: 2x1
    - Activation function output shape: 1x1

###
19. Give one common use case / application for each of the following types of neural network frameworks
    a. Convolutional Neural Network
        object identification
    b. Autoencoder
        Image compression (dimensionality reduction)
    c. Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) Network
        Chat bots, language prediction, translation 
    d. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
        Image, video synthesis (generation)

###
20. If a model type that we are using is prone to *very* high bias, and the training/test accuracy are 95% & 90% respectively, 
what is a reasonable validation (final hold-out) accuracy that we might expect when the final-hold out set is tested? 
Given an example of a model-type that would exhibit this type of bias-variance behavior
    
> Due to the high bias, it would be expected that the model is overfitting to training data & it is likely
that the model would perform poorly on hold-out data. Standard decision trees are commonly prone to  
high bias, which is why they are easily out performed by random forests & other ensemble or gradient boosted
methods for classification. 

###
20. What are 3 different methods of dimensionality reduction?

> PCA, heuristic (dropping irrelevant features), variable inflaiton factor

###
21. What is the difference between a relational & a non-relational database?

> Relational databases are structured, typically with a primary key & often foreign keys, set up 
with rows & columns. Non-relational databases (e.g. Elastic Search, Mongo, etc.) are typically document
based storage & are unstructured in format. 

###
22. What is a virtual machine? How do you create/access one?

A virtual machine is a computer that is being hosted on a remote server (cloud). It is spun 
up on a cloud server & accessed via SSH

###
23. What is Spark? Why is it considered superior than its predecessor (HDFS/MapReduce)?

> Spark is a modern distributed method for processing (ETL) with big data. With HDFS, results were always
written to hard disc, which is not optimal, while in Spark, "dataframes" are turned into Resilient 
Distributed Datasets (RDD) which operate on working memory (more efficient).

###
24. What is an API? (is this is simple, help explain to someone who might not know what it is)
    
> Application Programmer Interface: APIs allow you to interact with an external softaware/database. 
The API creator provides endpoints that expose data to users in a format that is chosen by the API creator.
For instance, most (all?) web links are endpoints that retrieve data from databases through servers. 

###
25. What are advantages of of batch-processing ML predictions in production? What about a
streaming framework? Are there better hybrid methods?

> Batch processing of model predictions can be used when predictions are not needed in real time 
(e.g. application that only serves daily weather predictions). If predictions are needed in real time
(e.g. actual weather apps, financial/stock predictions, etc.), they need to be delivered as close 
to when requested as possible. This is computationally expensive & requires a much more complex back-end
to support. In batch processing, predictions are simply stored in a database & queries when required.
