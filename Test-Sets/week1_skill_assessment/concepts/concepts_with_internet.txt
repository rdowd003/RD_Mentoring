Concepts Assessment

##############################################################################################################################
All of the concepts tested below are absolutely essential to (1) passing data science interviews, 
(2) understanding foundations of more complex topics, and (3) success as a data scientist. Each of
these topics are commonly asked about in both conceptual & code-based knowledge testing interviews
for data scientist positions. 

Responses do not need to be extensive. Explain where you feel it is necessary, but 
simplified / general answers will suffice, unless the question is asking for a specific calculation or definition

QUESTIONS
##############################################################################################################################

1. What is the derivative of 10e^x2?
    20e^x

2. What is the *partial* derivative of X^2Y^3 with respect to X? 
    2x*y^3

3. What is the variance of the vector: [0,8,3,5,7,3,2,6,8,9,10,15]?
    sample variance: 16.8

4. A group of 10 foot surgery patients had a mean weight of 240 pounds. 
The sample standard deviation was 25 pounds. Find a confidence interval for a sample 
for the true mean weight of all foot surgery patients. Find a 95% CI.
    224.50, 255.49

5. Flipping a fair coin 3 times, which has a higher probability of occurring first (or neither)?
    a. HTT
    b. HTH

    Same probability


6. What is a p-value? How do you interpret the value?
(Hint: the answer should include more than "statistical significance")
    p-value is the likelihood that the results didn't occur by accident. p=0.05 means there's a 5% chance the observed results could have occured randomly

7. What is the formula for Bayes Conditional probability? What does each component represent?
    P(Xi | Yi) The probability of observing some event, X, given some other event, Y,

8. What is the difference between an independent-sample vs paired-sample t-test? 
Give an example set up where you'd use each
    independent: you're testing two separate groups e.g. a test group and a control group
    paired: you're testing the same group two different times e.g. before and after applying the treatment
    
9. Nathan makes 60% of his free-throw attempts. If he shoots 12 free throws, what is the probability that he makes exactly 10?
(hint, use binomial distribution - feel free to use a python library, and paste code below if you do)
    scipy: ans = binom.pmf(10, 12, 0.6)

10. What is bootstrapping? How can bootsrtapping be used in the model development process?
    Resampling with replacement. It can "assess the variability of a sample statistic". 
    It makes sense theoretically, but I'm not sure when or why to use it for model development.

11. What are the assumptions of linear regression?
    linear relationship, multivariate normality, no multicollinearity, no auto-correlation, homoscedasticity


12. Considering the development of an image classification model, what is a scenario / application 
in which you would want to prioritize precision over recal (sensitivity)? What about recall over precision?
    prioritze precision when you can't accept false negatives (disease/cancer identification)
    prioritize recall when you don't want false negatives

13. What calculations are required to be made at each split of a decision tree algorithm?
    parent/child entropy, weighted entropy, information gain

14. What parameter(s) is (are) randomized in a Random Forest classifier?
    The features considered at each branch in the tree

15. What is gradient boosting & why is it useful?
    A technique that produces an ensemble model from other prediction models by minimizes a loss function

16. In clustering algoriths like Kmeans, how do data points get assigned to clusters?
    begin with random cluster centers. Assign each sample to the nearest cluster (euclidean distance or manhanttan distance i think)
    recalculate the cluster centers once all the samples are labeled. repeat until the centers don't change position

17. What are the steps involved in collaborative filtering? What is the difference betwen user- & item-based collaborative filtering?
    Item based: recommend an item if the user has liked similar items
    User based: recommend and item to a user if similar users have liked the item


18. In the neural-network architecture described below (assume all layers to be dense - i.e. fully connected),
fill in the missing array shapes:
(Hint, neural networks typically follow: output = X.W + b)

Input layer:
    - Input shape: 3x1
Single Hidden layer (2 nodes, tanh activation)
    - Weights shape: 3x1 YOUR ANSWER HERE
    - Bias_h shape: 3x1
    - Activation function output shape: ## YOUR ANSWER HERE
Final Output layer (2 nodes, sigmoid activation)
    - Weights shape: 2x2
    - Bias_o shape: 2x1
    - Activation function output shape: ## YOUR ANSWER HERE


19. Give one common use case / application for each of the following types of neural network frameworks
    a. Convolutional Neural Network
        Image classifier
    b. Autoencoder
        denoising
    c. Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) Network
        time-series prediction
    d. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
        image generation, enhancing


20. If a model type that we are using is prone to *very* high bias, and the training/test accuracy are 95% & 90% respectively, 
what is a reasonable validation (final hold-out) accuracy that we might expect when the final-hold out set is tested? 
Given an example of a model-type that would exhibit this type of bias-variance behavior


20. What are 3 different methods of dimensionality reduction?
    principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, t-distribited stochastic neighbor embedding


21. What is the difference between a relational & a non-relational database?
    Relational: tables. Non-relational: documents, graphs, columnar, key-value

22. What is a virtual machine? How do you create/access one?
    Using softaware instead of hardware to run programs and deploy apps. Many ways to create/access I assume.
    VMware is an industry leader i think, but i've used plenty of websites that set up a wondows OS playground
    to practice various skills. 

23. What is Spark? Why is it considered superior than its predecessor (HDFS/MapReduce)?
    Spark: data processing engine that splits processing between different nodes. 
    It uses RAM to cache and process data instead of a file system (like hadoop)

24. What is an API? (is this is simple, help explain to someone who might not know what it is)
    Allows to applications to talk to each other. Allows access to data through pre-defined "endpoints" (like an http request/query)

25. What are advantages of of batch-processing ML predictions in production? What about a
streaming framework? Are there better hybrid methods?
    unsure about this one since I haven't worked in production
