Concepts Assessment

##############################################################################################################################
All of the concepts tested below are absolutely essential to (1) passing data science interviews, 
(2) understanding foundations of more complex topics, and (3) success as a data scientist. Each of
these topics are commonly asked about in both conceptual & code-based knowledge testing interviews
for data scientist positions. 

Responses do not need to be extensive. Explain where you feel it is necessary, but 
simplified / general answers will suffice, unless the question is asking for a specific calculation or definition

QUESTIONS
##############################################################################################################################

1. What is the derivative of 10e^x2?


2. What is the *partial* derivative of X^2Y^3 with respect to X? 


3. What is the variance of the vector: [0,8,3,5,7,3,2,6,8,9,10,15]?


4. A group of 10 foot surgery patients had a mean weight of 240 pounds. 
The sample standard deviation was 25 pounds. Find a confidence interval for a sample 
for the true mean weight of all foot surgery patients. Find a 95% CI.


5. Flipping a fair coin 3 times, which has a higher probability of occurring first (or neither)?
    a. HTT
    b. HTH


6. What is a p-value? How do you interpret the value?
(Hint: the answer should include more than "statistical significance")


7. What is the formula for Bayes Conditional probability? What does each component represent?


8. What is the difference between an independent-sample vs paired-sample t-test? 
Give an example set up where you'd use each


9. Nathan makes 60% of his free-throw attempts. If he shoots 12 free throws, what is the probability that he makes exactly 10?
(hint, use binomial distribution - feel free to use a python library, and paste code below if you do)


10. What is bootstrapping? How can bootsrtapping be used in the model development process?


11. What are the assumptions of linear regression?


12. Considering the development of an image classification model, what is a scenario / application 
in which you would want to prioritize precision over recal (sensitivity)? What about recall over precision?
    prioritze precision when you can't accept false negatives (disease/cancer identification)
    prioritize recall when you don't want false negatives 

13. Given the same model output as above, answer the following questions:
    a. What do you notice about the class-balance of actual labels?
    
    b. What is the impact of your answer to (a) on the model's ability to successfully predict the given labels?


13. What calculations are required to be made at each split of a decision tree algorithm?


14. What parameter(s) is (are) randomized in a Random Forest classifier?


15. What is gradient boosting & why is it useful?


16. In clustering algoriths like Kmeans, how do data points get assigned to clusters?


17. What are the steps involved in collaborative filtering? What is the difference betwen user- & item-based collaborative filtering?



18. In the neural-network architecture described below (assume all layers to be dense - i.e. fully connected),
fill in the missing array shapes:
(Hint, neural networks typically follow: output = X.W + b)

Input layer:
    - Input shape: 3x1
Single Hidden layer (2 nodes, tanh activation)
    - Weights shape: ## YOUR ANSWER HERE
    - Bias_h shape: 3x1
    - Activation function output shape: ## YOUR ANSWER HERE
Final Output layer (2 nodes, sigmoid activation)
    - Weights shape: 2x2
    - Bias_o shape: 2x1
    - Activation function output shape: ## YOUR ANSWER HERE


19. Give one common use case / application for each of the following types of neural network frameworks
    a. Convolutional Neural Network
        object identification
    b. Autoencoder
        semantic segmentation
    c. Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) Network
        timeseries 
    d. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
        cyber security? Use an adversarial model to try to fool your defensive model. Not really certain though

20. If a model type that we are using is prone to *very* high bias, and the training/test accuracy are 95% & 90% respectively, 
what is a reasonable validation (final hold-out) accuracy that we might expect when the final-hold out set is tested? 
Given an example of a model-type that would exhibit this type of bias-variance behavior
    If the training algorithm used kfolds and each iteration achieved ~90% test accuracy, then I would expect the final hold-out accuracy to be less than 90. 
    If the training did not use kfolds, then I would expect the final accuracy to be similar to the test accuracy, 
        because the model was never trained on the test data. 


20. What are 3 different methods of dimensionality reduction?
    LDA, 



21. What is the difference between a relational & a non-relational database?
    relational databases are essential tabular data (rows, cols). non-relational databases include graphs, documents (similar to JSON) and a couple others.
    NRDs typically contain one-to-many relationships


22. What is a virtual machine? How do you create/access one?
    running an instance of some other system on a computer; similar to an emulator. 


23. What is Spark? Why is it considered superior than its predecessor (HDFS/MapReduce)?


24. What is an API? (is this is simple, help explain to someone who might not know what it is)
    APIs allow you to interact with an external softaware/database. 
    The API creator provides endpoints that expose data to users in a format that is chosen by the API creator.
    For instance, most (all?) web links are endpoints that retrieve data from databases through servers. 

25. What are advantages of of batch-processing ML predictions in production? What about a
streaming framework? Are there better hybrid methods?
