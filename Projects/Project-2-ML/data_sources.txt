DATA SOURCES FOR PROJECT 2

Ultimately, the data source you would like to use for this project
is up to you. However, below is a list of potential sources 
you may be interested in utilizing, as well as some recommended model
types to use for each. Some data sources are downloadable directly, and
others would require the use of an API. The latter would be an excellent
way to demonstrate proficiency in skills outside of the standard data
science repetoire.


# Potential Sources
######################################################################################
1. Spotify API - Use Spotipy (python library for Spotify API) 
Also API call script provided; feel free to write your own

Source: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/

Example extracting track features
https://medium.com/@samlupton/spotipy-get-features-from-your-favourite-songs-in-python-6d71f0172df0

Data Contents: Using the Spotify API, you can call for a wide variety
of data for any song available in the Spotify database (as well as user & playlist data). 
Within this data is a number of pre-engineered (by Spotify's engineers) data features
which are described in length here: (link). There is a call limit , however you can 
create a loop to pull a larger dataset through the API. 

Recommended uses:
	- Clustering
	- Classification

2. Zillow API
(try with pyzillow as well
https://pypi.org/project/pyzillow/)

Source: https://www.zillow.com/howto/api/APIOverview.htm?source=post_page

Example using Zillow API for data science
https://towardsdev.com/estated-api-get-real-estate-property-data-using-python-1613228e5601

Data Contents: The zillow API is a rich source of interesting data related to the real estate
market. Through the zillow API, you will have access to housing market & geographical data, 
mortgage data & more. 

Recommended uses:
	- Prediction
	- Clustering

3. UCI - Parkinsons UPDRS dataset

Source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/parkinsons/telemonitoring/

Data Contents: This dataset is pre-engineered & designed mainly for prediction. The 
zipfile of data you will download contains Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scores
data for several neurology patients. This is a neurological rating system
designed to label the severity of symptoms exhibited by patients visiting a
neruology clinic. There are also a few published academic studies using this
data which may serve as a guide source. As this is a public dataset with many
existing uses, please do not copy the work of others. 

Recommended uses:
	- Clustering
	- Prediction (regression, time series)
	- Potential Classification



######################################################################################
4. Marketing campaign study

Source: Request files folder. You will be asked not to push the data to your profile

Data contents: This dataset contains several data points related to (anonymized) business 
accounts belonging to a particular vendor. The target variable is an outcome indicating
their responsiveness to a marketing campaign run by the vendor. The data includes many 
features describing the business type, their responses to prior campaigns & more. 

Recommended uses:
	- Classification
	- Potential prediction
	- Potential clustering
