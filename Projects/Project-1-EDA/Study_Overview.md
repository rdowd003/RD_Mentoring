from study owners using this data [Publication 1](xxx) & [Publication 2](xxx))

Study date:  Jan 2007 to Jan 2009Subjects with intensively-treated type 1 diabetes and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 7.0%-10.0% in 3 age groups (>25, 15-24, 8-14) were randomized to a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) group or control group. The primary outcome was change in HbA1c after 26 weeks. A parallel randomized trial was conducted for a second cohort with HbA1c <7.0% that followed an identical protocol to that of the first cohort with HbA1c >=7.0%.

The >=7.0% trial was specifically designed and statistically powered to compare separately the impact of continuous versus standard intensive glucose monitoring in the three age groups. Both trials used standardized treatment algorithms and equivalent frequent contacts with subjects in both the CGM and control group.

After completion of the 26-week trial, the CGM group continued to use CGM for another 26 weeks to evaluate whether any beneficial effect seen in the first 6 months was sustained with longer-term use and less intensive contact and the control group initiated CGM use with less intensive contact after the first month than was provided at initiation of CGM use in the CGM group in the randomized trial.

Types of data collected:

	1. RT-CGM
	2. Lab-collected hbA1C
	3. Patient demographics
	4. Surveys &  Responses
		- Health Services Utilization
		- CGM Satisfaction
		- Hypoglycemia Fear
		- Complication Utilities Services
		- Experienced Utility Services
		- Treatment Related Services
		- Income & Insurance
		- Parental / caretaker survey (if applicable to pt)
		- Cost Effectiveness

[Well controlled cohort](https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/32/8/1378/38871/The-Effect-of-Continuous-Glucose-Monitoring-in):
	"Most outcomes, including those combining A1C and hypoglycemia, favored the CGM group. The weight of evidence suggests that CGM is beneficial for individuals with type 1 diabetes who have already achieved excellent control with A1C <7.0%."
	
[Poor controlled cohort](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0805017):
	"Continuous glucose monitoring can be associated with improved glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes. Further work is needed to identify barriers to effectiveness of continuous monitoring in children and adolescents"
